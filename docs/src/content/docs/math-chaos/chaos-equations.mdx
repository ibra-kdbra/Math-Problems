<TextBlock size="lg" maxWidth="3xl" isProse={true} invertInDark={true}>
Simple mathematical art created with C++, OpenGL, and other libraries. This project explores artistic patterns generated through chaotic recursive equations.
</TextBlock>

## Concept Overview

<TextBlock size="lg" maxWidth="3xl" isProse={true} invertInDark={true}>
These are plots of random recursive equations, which often produce chaos, resulting in beautiful patterns.
For every time t, a point (x,y) is initialized to (t,t).
The equation is applied to the point many times, and each
iteration is drawn in a unique color.
</TextBlock>

## ShowCase

![]()


## Controls

<ControlsTable
  controls={[
    { key: "A", description: "Automatic Mode (randomize equations)" },
    { key: "R", description: "Repeat Mode (keep same equation)" },
    { key: "C", description: "Center points" },
    { key: "D", description: "Dot size Toggle" },
    { key: "I", description: "Iteration Limit Toggle" },
    { key: "T", description: "Trail Toggle" },
    { key: "P", description: "Pause" },
    { key: "LShift", description: "Slow Down" },
    { key: "RShift", description: "Speed Up" },
    { key: "Space", description: "Reverse" },
    { key: "N", description: "New Equation (random)" },
    { key: "L", description: "Load Equation" },
    { key: "S", description: "Save Equation" },

## Usage 
<TextBlock size="base" maxWidth="3xl" isProse={true} invertInDark={true}>
