Rendering fractals with the [Buddhabrot technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot) discovered by [Melinda Green](http://superliminal.com/fractals/).

An optimization is implemented to compute "hint" points, i.e. points that are likely to produce viable samples.

Only points that escape between the minimum and maximum recursion depth are relevant in later stages. Thus these points are saved as "hints" and are used for later computation.

Additionally, a histogram method is used to compute the final brightness of each pixel in the exported image.

A single hint file can be reused across multiple iterations of fractal rendering. It may either be precomputed and read from disk or generated on demand. Notably, its configuration—such as resolution—does not need to precisely match that of the final image. Instead, the hint file simply needs to contain high-quality candidate points to seed the recursive rendering process efficiently.

To finalize the image, a histogram-based method is employed to determine pixel brightness. The darkest 1⁄256th of pixels are mapped to black (0, 0, 0), the next 1⁄256th to (1, 1, 1), and so on, scaling linearly up to the brightest value of (255, 255, 255).

This implementation has been tested using `clang++` on Arch Linux.
