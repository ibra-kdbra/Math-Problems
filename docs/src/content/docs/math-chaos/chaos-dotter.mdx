# Chaos Visual

## Overview

This HTML project creates an interactive visualization of a mathematical concept known as the **Chaos Game**. 
It generates fractal patterns by repeatedly plotting a point that moves a certain percentage toward randomly chosen vertices of a polygon.

---

## Key Features

- Canvas-based visualizer for fractal/chaotic behavior.
- Input for choosing number of polygon vertices.
- Input for adjusting the travel distance percentage.
- Looping background audio.
- Styled using Semantic UI and jQuery for interactive elements.

---

## How It Works

<Steps>
1. **Audio Playback**  
   - Plays `Gesaffelstei-Aleph.mp3` automatically on page load, in a loop.

2. **Polygon Setup**  
   - User inputs how many vertices the polygon should have (≥3).
   - User inputs the percentage of distance to travel towards a randomly chosen vertex (e.g., 61.8%).

3. **Canvas Drawing**  
   - A `<canvas>` element is used to draw.
   - The polygon vertices are placed around a circle.
   - A dot starts from a random position and keeps moving toward randomly chosen vertices.

4. **Chaos Algorithm**  
   - Each iteration:
     - Pick a random vertex.
     - Move the point a percentage closer to it.
     - Draw the new position.
   - Repeated hundreds of times per second to form a visual pattern.
</Steps>

## ShowCase

## Technical Details

- **Libraries Used**:
  - jQuery 3.1.1
  - Semantic UI 2.4.2

- **Important Elements**:
  - `<canvas>`: Visualizes points.
  - `<input>`: Collects user parameters.
  - `<button>`: Triggers the main drawing routine.

- **Script Logic**:
  - `playForSide()`: Validates input and initializes drawing.
  - `init()`: Clears the canvas and begins drawing.
  - `draw()`: Executes the chaos pattern logic in a loop.
  - `colorCircle()` & `colorRect()`: Helpers to draw on canvas.

---

## Extras

- Accordion UI explains how the algorithm works for curious users.
- Responsive layout (with a minimum width set).
- Integrated with Google Analytics.

---

## Try It Out

- Enter a number ≥ 3 for vertices.
- Try 61.8 (inverse golden ratio) for stunning visuals.
- Click **"Amaze me!"** to generate the pattern.
