# DNS Protocol Library

<TextBlock size="lg" maxWidth="3xl" isProse invertInDark>
Simple C++ library designed for encoding and decoding of DNS protocol packets. It doesn't provide
any functionality related to network (listening for packets, sending packets, etc.). Library is strictly
focused on handling of DNS protocol packets - mapping of raw (wire) data to C++ structures (classes)
and vice versa.

### Usage

<Steps>
1. Install cmake tools
    ``` 
    sudo apt install cmake
    ```

2. Create Build directory
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```

3. Generate build artifacts
    ```
    cmake ../src
    ```

4. Build binaries
    ```
    make
    ```

5. Run unittests
    ```
    ./unittests
    ```
</Steps>
