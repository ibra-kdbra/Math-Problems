# Deployment
## Deploying to Vercel
Below are the steps to deploy your Astro project to Vercel.

<Steps>
1. Install Vercel CLI

    First, install the Vercel CLI globally if you haven't already:

    ```script 
    npm install -g vercel
    ```
2. Login to Vercel

    Authenticate your CLI with your Vercel account:

    ```script
    vercel login
    ```

3. Deploy the Project

    Navigate to your project's root directory and run the deploy command:

    ```script
    vercel
    ```
</Steps>

## Deploying to Netlify

Here's how you can deploy your Astro project to Netlify.

<Steps>
1. Install Netlify CLI

    Begin by installing the Netlify CLI globally:

    ```script
    npm install -g netlify-cli
    ```

2. Login to Netlify

    Authenticate your CLI with your Netlify account:

    ```script
    netlify login
    ```

3. Update `astro.config.mjs` for Netlify

    Replace the Vercel adapter with Netlify's adapter in your `astro.config.mjs`:

    ```js import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
    import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
    import react from '@astrojs/react';
    import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import astroDocs from './integrations/astroDocs';

    export default defineConfig({
    output: 'hybrid',
    adapter: netlify({
        functions: {
        // Optional: Specify the directory for Netlify Functions
        directory: 'netlify/functions',
        },anchors: [
            {
            //rest of the file
            ]}
    ```

4. Build and Deploy

    Run the build command to generate the `dist` directory:

    ```script
    npm run build
    ```

    Deploy the project to Netlify:

    ```script
    netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
    ```
    Follow the prompts to complete the deployment. Netlify will automatically handle the rest.
