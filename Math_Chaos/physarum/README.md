# Physarum Transport Networks

![Example](./images/black_gold.png)

This is a particle-based simulation inspired by the _Physarum polycephalum_
slime mold.

Details about the algorithm can be found on Sage Jenson's excellent [webpage](https://sagejenson.com/physarum)

The algorithm is surprisingly simple given how complex its outputs appear.
That's the magic of generative algorithms!

## Usage

    go run cmd/physarum/main.go
