// Test 1 of the new two-gene type preference niche.
// Observations: 
// In the first run, all the swimbot races that survived the garden of eden are now all eating the same type of foodbit. Each time a food bit gets eaten it will regenerate to a random type foodbit. Whenever a new food bit spawns as the type that is not prefered by the pool, it basically gets locked away "forever." Thus, over time the pond loses prefered food bits more and more until all the food bits are just one type. This is my hunch, but let's see if this happens. Yes, I think this is a problem. One food type dominates the board when it isn't being eaten quickly enough.
// To keep food bits balanced, what about setting it so that when a yellow food bit is eaten, a yellow food bit is spawned, and same for blue food bits. Currently, if food bit mutation rate is set to zero, then the next food bit will spawn to the more abundant type.

// So far 3 out of 4 pools went extinct. The one pool that survived evolved to "one" apparent species by timestep 2.5mil, where one group ate one group of swimbots ate one type of food type (it's prefered) and did fine, while the other group ate a non-prefered food type (getting only 5 energy points from each food bit). But instead of dying out, this other group is such a good swimmer that it eats all the non-prefered food bits anyway!

// saved simulations: food_niche_1.txt (400 starting pop)
// increasing starting population to 800 and then 1000 to prevent instant extinction...
// Turns out that because of the new food genes, only half of all random swimbots will be able to eat healthfully (food preference matches digestable food type). And since there are two separate types, you divide that number into two since each gets access to only half the food.
// 1600 swimbots would provide 800 viable swimbots (400 for each type). I also increased food to 2000 foodbits--but this didn't work either!

// Going to try setting a larger starting radius so the swimbots and food are more spread out but then with a starting number of 1000 bots and 2000 food bits. Ok, this seems to have worked.. 
// Saved this one as: food_niche_2.txt. It reached almost 40k swimbots but it went extinct eventually. I think because of the food problem. food_niche_3 through 7 are also the same thing.

// Next I will run a series of tests after removing the food niche 2 gene thing by changing the food type offset to 1 (so the food type gene has no effect). All the previous ones had food type offset set to 0.1, meaning a swimbot gets only 10% of the energy from a food bit if it is not adapted to that food type. These new tests are called food_niche_reg_#.txt, beginign with number 1.
