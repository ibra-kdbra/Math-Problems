# Chaos-Equations
Simple mathematical art

This is for trying many arts using simple mathmatic equations and simulate them using c++,CASSERT,SFML,OPENGL

## Summary
These are plots of random recursive equations, which
often produce chaos, and results in beautiful patterns.
For every time t, a point (x,y) is initialized to (t,t).
The equation is applied to the point many times, and each
iteration is drawn in a unique color.
