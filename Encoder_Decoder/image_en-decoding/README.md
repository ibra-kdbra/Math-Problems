# IMage Encoder Decoder

A C++ JPG Encoder/Decoder

IMage encodes uncompressed BMPs and outputs them as baseline JPGs.

IMage decodes all standard JPGs (baseline, progressive, subsampled) and outputs them in BMP format.

This project was created for the video series, [**Everything You Need to Know About JPEG**][yt].
